mini project2, identify objects

the two models are CNN and VGG19, other files are associated but not for assignment.

the format of images:
1. train folder: one class (daisy folder)
              another class (sunflower folder)
2. validation folder: one class (daisy folder)
                   another class (sunflower folder)

#using this kind of format, I do not need to add label in excel/csv file


during the process, I have tried different methods

0. basic CNN
1. googlenet_inceptionV3
2. vgg16+tensorflow
